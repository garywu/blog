# 3-Composition: Blog Writing & Synthesis Prompts

## Purpose
Prompts for Phase 4 - Synthesis & Composition. Transform insights into compelling, well-structured blog posts that effectively communicate your thesis.

## Blog Structure Development

### Opening Hook Creation
```
Help me create a compelling opening for my blog post:

My thesis: [THESIS STATEMENT]
Target audience: [AUDIENCE DESCRIPTION]
Key insight: [MAIN INSIGHT]

Hook development options:

1. Surprising fact approach: What counterintuitive fact from my research would grab attention?
2. Personal story approach: What relatable scenario illustrates my thesis?
3. Current event approach: What recent news connects to my argument?
4. Question approach: What intriguing question would pull readers in?
5. Scene-setting approach: What specific moment in time/place embodies my thesis?

Create 3 different opening hooks with different approaches and emotional tones.
```

### Thesis Statement Integration
```
Help me integrate my thesis naturally into the blog post flow:

Research-based thesis: [ANALYTICAL THESIS]
Blog audience: [TARGET READERS]
Opening approach: [CHOSEN HOOK]

Thesis integration strategy:

1. Where in the opening should the thesis appear for maximum impact?
2. How can I preview the thesis without giving everything away?
3. What language makes the thesis accessible to my audience?
4. How do I frame the thesis as valuable to readers?
5. What promise should I make about what readers will gain?

Make the thesis feel natural and compelling, not academic.
```

### Narrative Arc Construction
```
Structure my verified research and insights into a compelling narrative:

Available elements:
- Research facts: [KEY FACTS FROM ATOMIC FILES]
- Analytical insights: [MAIN INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS]
- Target transformation: [HOW READERS SHOULD THINK DIFFERENTLY]

Narrative construction:

1. What's the logical sequence for presenting evidence?
2. Where should I place the most surprising insights?
3. How do I build to the strongest conclusions?
4. Where should I address counterarguments?
5. What examples or stories will make each section memorable?

Create a narrative arc that guides readers from curiosity to conviction.
```

## Content Integration Prompts

### Research-to-Story Conversion
```
Transform my atomic research files into engaging narrative elements:

Research file: [SPECIFIC ATOMIC FILE]
Key facts: [MAIN FACTS FROM FILE]
Blog section: [WHERE THIS FITS IN NARRATIVE]

Story conversion:

1. What's the most engaging way to present these facts?
2. How can I make technical details relatable and interesting?
3. What analogies would help readers grasp complex concepts?
4. How do I integrate sources naturally without breaking flow?
5. What details add color and engagement vs. unnecessary complexity?

Turn facts into compelling story elements.
```

### Insight-to-Application Bridge
```
Connect my analytical insights to practical reader value:

Key insight: [SPECIFIC INSIGHT FROM ANALYSIS]
Target audience: [READER DESCRIPTION]

Application development:

1. How does this insight change how readers should think or act?
2. What specific examples demonstrate this insight in action?
3. What tools or frameworks can readers immediately use?
4. How does this insight solve problems readers actually face?
5. What would readers do differently after understanding this?

Make insights actionable and valuable.
```

### Technical Simplification
```
Make complex technical information accessible without dumbing it down:

Technical content: [COMPLEX INFORMATION FROM RESEARCH]
Audience level: [READER BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE]

Simplification strategy:

1. What analogies make this concept immediately graspable?
2. How can I build up to complexity gradually?
3. What examples demonstrate this in everyday terms?
4. Which technical details are essential vs. distracting?
5. How do I maintain accuracy while improving accessibility?

Preserve precision while maximizing clarity.
```

## Writing Quality Prompts

### Ogilvy Principles Application
```
Review my draft section for Ogilvy's writing principles:

Draft content: [SECTION OF BLOG POST]

Ogilvy checklist:

2. Are sentences and paragraphs short enough for easy reading?
3. Have I removed unnecessary jargon or complex terms?
4. Is it crystal clear what I want readers to think or do?
5. Have I checked all quotes and factual claims?

Suggest specific improvements based on Ogilvy's timeless principles.
```

### Flow and Transition Optimization
```
Improve the flow between sections of my blog post:

Section A: [CONTENT OF FIRST SECTION]
Section B: [CONTENT OF SECOND SECTION]

Flow analysis:

1. How do these sections logically connect?
2. What transition would make the connection smoother?
3. Are there gaps in logic that need bridging?
4. How can I maintain reader engagement across the transition?
5. What questions does Section A raise that Section B should answer?

Create seamless transitions that guide reader thinking.
```

### Engagement Optimization
```
Make my blog content more engaging without sacrificing substance:

Current draft: [SECTION TO IMPROVE]
Target feeling: [HOW READERS SHOULD FEEL]

Engagement techniques:

1. Where can I add concrete, relatable examples?
2. How can I make this more personal and relevant to readers?
3. What surprising elements would maintain interest?
4. Where can I use questions to involve readers mentally?
5. How can I vary sentence structure and rhythm for better flow?

Enhance engagement while maintaining credibility.
```

## Quality Control Prompts

### Fact Integration Verification
```
Verify that all research facts are properly integrated and accurate:

Blog draft section: [SECTION WITH FACTUAL CLAIMS]
Source material: [RELEVANT ATOMIC RESEARCH FILES]

Verification checklist:

1. Are all factual claims supported by verified research?
2. Are sources integrated naturally without disrupting flow?
3. Have I maintained accuracy while making content accessible?
4. Are there any unsupported claims that crept in during writing?
5. Do quoted materials and statistics match my source documentation?

Ensure zero hallucinations in the final content.
```

### Audience Appropriateness Check
```
