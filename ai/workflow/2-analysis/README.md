# 2-Analysis: MCP Sequential Thinking Prompts

## Purpose
Prompts for Phase 3 - MCP Sequential Thinking Analysis. Transform verified research into insights through progressive analysis and creative synthesis.

## Sequential Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Narrative Arc Mapping
```
Based on my verified research, help me identify the narrative arc:

My thesis: [THESIS STATEMENT]
Research completed: [SUMMARY OF ATOMIC RESEARCH FILES]

Analyze the story structure:

1. What journey do my facts reveal from beginning to end?
2. What emotional arc should readers experience?
3. What transformation in thinking should occur?
4. Where are the natural tension points and resolution moments?
5. What's the most compelling way to sequence these insights?

Help me find the narrative thread that connects all my research.
```

### Step 2: Atomic Node Synthesis  
```
Help me synthesize patterns across my atomic research files:

Research files: [LIST OF ATOMIC FILES]
Key facts from each: [SUMMARY OF KEY FACTS]

Pattern recognition analysis:

1. What themes appear across multiple research files?
2. Where do facts from different files strengthen each other?
3. What contradictions exist, and what do they reveal?
4. Which individual facts scale up to bigger implications?
5. What unexpected connections emerge between disparate research areas?

Show me how the pieces fit together into larger insights.
```

### Step 3: Sequential Ramification Analysis
```
Develop the implications of my insights through progressive layers:

Core insight: [MAIN INSIGHT FROM SYNTHESIS]

Layer 1 - Direct implications: What immediately follows from this insight?
Layer 2 - Deeper consequences: What second-order effects emerge?
Layer 3 - Paradigm shifts: What fundamental assumptions change?
Layer 4 - Civilizational impact: What does this mean for humanity?

Walk me through each layer systematically, building complexity progressively.
```

### Step 4: Creative Process Generation
```
Based on my analysis, help me identify reusable thinking frameworks:

My research revealed: [KEY PATTERNS AND INSIGHTS]

Framework development:

1. What thinking patterns emerged from my analysis process?
2. What methodology could others use for similar problems?
3. What analogies make my insights accessible to broader audiences?
4. What tools or frameworks does my research enable?
5. How could someone apply this thinking to different domains?

Create practical frameworks others can use.
```

### Step 5: "So What?" Creative Synthesis
```
Help me articulate why anyone should care about my discoveries:

My key insights: [SUMMARY OF MAIN INSIGHTS]
Target audience: [AUDIENCE DESCRIPTION]

Significance analysis:

1. How does this affect individual readers personally?
2. What professional applications emerge from these insights?
3. What societal changes might result from this understanding?
4. Why is this more important than other things competing for attention?
5. What specific actions should readers take based on this knowledge?

Make the significance crystal clear and compelling.
```

## Specialized Analysis Prompts

### Historical Pattern Recognition
```
Apply archaeological reasoning to my research findings:

Research topic: [TOPIC]
Historical data: [HISTORICAL FACTS FROM RESEARCH]

Archaeological analysis framework:

1. What specific moment in history represents the key change?
2. What's the earliest similar pattern I can trace?
3. How did this phenomenon scale from simple to complex?
4. What makes this uniquely human vs. other species/phenomena?
5. Where does this pattern lead in 10/100/1000 years?

Use deep-time perspective to understand present implications.
```

### Four-Track Technology Analysis
```
Analyze my research through human environmental technology evolution:

Technology/phenomenon: [RESEARCH SUBJECT]

Four-track analysis:

1. Language Enhancement: How does this change human communication?
2. Territorial Impact: How does it alter concepts of space and place?
3. Social Coordination: How does it scale or change group cooperation?
4. Protection Systems: How does it enhance human defense capabilities?
5. Convergence Assessment: Does it integrate multiple tracks simultaneously?

Evaluate through human augmentation lens.
```

### Atomic-to-Civilizational Scaling
```
Connect my specific discoveries to species-level implications:

Specific discovery: [KEY RESEARCH FINDING]

Scaling analysis:

1. Individual Impact: How does this change what one person can do?
2. Group Dynamics: How does it alter community organization?
3. Species Capability: What new collective abilities emerge?
4. Evolutionary Significance: Is this a new type of human capability?
5. Long-term Trajectory: What does this suggest about human future?

Scale from concrete facts to civilizational implications.
```

## Insight Development Prompts

### Metaphor and Analogy Generation
```
Help me create powerful analogies for my complex insights:

Complex insight: [INSIGHT TO EXPLAIN]
Target audience: [AUDIENCE DESCRIPTION]

Analogy development:

1. What everyday experiences parallel this insight?
2. What natural phenomena exhibit similar patterns?
3. What historical analogies would resonate with my audience?
4. What simple mechanical or physical processes mirror this?
5. Which analogy makes the complex insight immediately graspable?

Create analogies that make complex ideas accessible.
```

### Contradiction Resolution
```
Help me resolve apparent contradictions in my research:

Contradictory findings: [DESCRIPTION OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION]

Resolution analysis:

1. Are both facts actually true in different contexts?
2. What additional context reconciles the contradiction?
3. Does the contradiction reveal a deeper truth?
4. Which perspective is more fundamental or accurate?
5. How can I present both sides fairly while maintaining clarity?

Turn contradictions into insights.
```

### Pattern Extrapolation
```
Help me extrapolate patterns from my research to broader applications:

Identified pattern: [PATTERN FROM RESEARCH]

Extrapolation analysis:

1. Where else might this pattern apply?
2. What other domains exhibit similar dynamics?
3. What predictions does this pattern enable?
4. What would change if this pattern accelerated or reversed?
5. How can readers recognize this pattern in their own contexts?

Extend insights beyond the original research domain.
```

## Creative Synthesis Prompts

### Framework Creation
```
Transform my insights into a practical framework others can use:

Core insights: [KEY INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS]

Framework development:

1. What are the essential steps or principles?
2. How would someone apply this systematically?
3. What examples illustrate each component?
4. What common mistakes should be avoided?
5. How can this be adapted for different contexts?

Create a reusable methodology from my insights.
```

### Paradigm Shift Articulation
```
Help me articulate how my insights challenge conventional thinking:

Conventional wisdom: [WHAT PEOPLE NORMALLY BELIEVE]
My insights: [WHAT MY RESEARCH REVEALS]

Paradigm analysis:

1. What fundamental assumptions are challenged?
2. How does this reframe common problems or questions?
3. What becomes possible that wasn't before?
4. What resistance might this insight encounter?
5. How can I present this shift constructively rather than confrontationally?

Frame new paradigms thoughtfully.
```

### Application Brainstorming
```
Generate practical applications for my insights:

Key insight: [MAIN INSIGHT]
Target domains: [WHERE THIS MIGHT APPLY]

Application development:

1. How could professionals in relevant fields use this?
2. What tools or products could embody this insight?
3. What educational approaches does this suggest?
4. How might this influence policy or decision-making?
5. What immediate actions can readers take?

Make insights actionable.
```

## Quality Control

### Insight Validation
```
Validate the strength and accuracy of my analytical insights:

Proposed insights: [LIST OF KEY INSIGHTS]
Supporting research: [RESEARCH FOUNDATION]

Validation questions:

1. Is each insight logically supported by verified facts?
2. Are there alternative explanations I haven't considered?
3. Do my insights add genuine value beyond obvious conclusions?
4. Are there holes in my reasoning or unsupported leaps?
5. Would experts in relevant fields find these insights credible?

Ensure analytical rigor.
```

### Readiness Assessment
```
Assess whether my analysis is ready for composition phase:

Completed analysis: [SUMMARY OF ANALYTICAL WORK]

Readiness checklist:

1. Do I have compelling insights that go beyond my research facts?
2. Is the significance clear and well-articulated?
3. Have I developed practical frameworks or applications?
4. Are potential objections addressed through analysis?
5. Can I explain the "so what?" in one clear sentence?

Determine if analysis foundation is solid for writing.
```
