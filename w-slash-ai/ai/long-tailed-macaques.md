# Long-Tailed Macaques: Rock Tool Users

## Basic Facts
- **Species**: Macaca fascicularis
- **Common Name**: Long-tailed macaque, crab-eating macaque
- **Location**: Southeast Asia, especially Thailand coastal areas
- **Population**: Found on islands and mainland

## Tool Use Behavior
- **Primary Tool**: Rocks and stones for cracking shellfish
- **Target Prey**: Oysters, crabs, sea snails, mussels
- **Technique**: Hammering and anvil use
- **Frequency**: Up to 80% of coastal populations use stone tools

## Specific Examples

### Thailand Coastal Populations
- **Location**: Laem Son National Park, Ko Yao Islands
- **Behavior**: Select stones 6-15cm in diameter
- **Prey**: Primarily oysters attached to mangrove roots
- **Success**: Can crack open 4-6 shellfish per minute

### Tool Selection Criteria
- **Size preference**: Medium rocks (6-15cm)
- **Weight**: Heavy enough for impact, light enough to manipulate
- **Shape**: Generally round or oval preferred
- **Transport**: Carry tools up to 20 meters to anvil sites

## Cultural Transmission
- **Learning**: Young macaques observe mothers for 2-3 years
- **Practice**: Juveniles practice with smaller stones and softer targets
- **Regional differences**: Island vs mainland populations show different techniques
- **Population variation**: Some coastal groups never develop tool use

## Significance
Represents sophisticated primate tool use outside of great apes, with clear cultural learning patterns and regional specialization in marine environments.
