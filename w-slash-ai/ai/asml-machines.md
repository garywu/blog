# ASML EUV Lithography Machines

## The Machine
- **Company**: ASML Holding N.V. (Netherlands, founded 1984)
- **Weight**: 180 tons (equivalent to commercial airliner)
- **Cost**: Up to $370 million per machine
- **Transport**: Requires 3 Boeing 747s to ship all components
- **Precision**: Creates patterns as small as 8 nanometers

## The Molten Tin Process

### Droplet Generation
- **Material**: Molten tin droplets (NOT aluminum)
- **Size**: 30 micrometers in diameter
- **Frequency**: 50,000 droplets per second
- **Temperature**: Tin heated to liquid state

### Laser System
- **Type**: High-energy CO2 laser
- **Wavelength**: 10.6 micrometers
- **Power**: 25 kilowatts
- **Target**: Each individual tin droplet
- **Result**: Creates plasma at 200,000°C (hotter than sun's surface)

### EUV Light Creation
- **Process**: Superheated tin plasma emits extreme ultraviolet light
- **Wavelength**: 13.5 nanometers
- **Environment**: Complete vacuum (EUV light absorbed by air)
- **Frequency**: Light pulses synchronized with droplet generation

## Mirror System
- **Mirrors**: 11 ultra-precise mirrors per machine
- **Manufacturer**: Carl Zeiss (Germany)
- **Precision**: Polished to atomic-level smoothness
- **Scale**: If mirror scaled to size of Germany, largest bump would be 1mm
- **Function**: Bounces EUV light to focus pattern onto silicon wafer

## Manufacturing Process
- **Wafer coating**: Silicon wafer coated with photoresist (light-sensitive material)
- **Pattern transfer**: Light passes through mask containing circuit pattern
- **Scaling**: Pattern is 4x larger than final chip, optics shrink it down
- **Layers**: Each chip requires 100+ layers of patterns
- **Positioning**: Nanometer-precise wafer movement

## Production Capabilities
- **Throughput**: 170+ wafers per hour for advanced chips
- **Operating schedule**: 24/7 in semiconductor fabs
- **Clean room requirements**: 10,000x cleaner than hospital operating room
- **Precision requirements**: Must account for Earth's curvature

## Global Impact
- **Market position**: Only company making EUV machines globally
- **Customers**: TSMC, Samsung, Intel, other leading chipmakers
- **Revenue**: €28.26 billion (2024)
- **Employees**: 43,395 worldwide
