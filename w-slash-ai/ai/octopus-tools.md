# Octopus: Intelligent Invertebrate Tool Users

## Species Overview
- **Primary species**: Amphioctopus marginatus (veined/coconut octopus)
- **Location**: Northern Sulawesi and Bali, Indonesia
- **Intelligence**: Among most cognitively advanced invertebrates
- **Uniqueness**: First documented invertebrate tool use for future deployment

## Coconut Shell Tools

### Collection Behavior
- **Source**: Discarded coconut shells settled on ocean floor  
- **Selection**: Choose half-shells that can stack together
- **Transport**: Carry shells while "stilt-walking" across seafloor
- **Distance**: Transport up to 20 meters from collection site

### Assembly & Use
- **Storage**: Stack shell halves inside each other when moving
- **Deployment**: Assemble into protective dome when threatened
- **Shelter**: Create enclosed space for hiding from predators
- **Conditional use**: Only deploy as shelter when specific threat detected

## Other Tool Behaviors

### Water as Tool
- **Burrowing**: Use water jets to excavate sand for hiding
- **Foraging**: Direct water jets to uncover buried prey
- **Defense**: Squirt water at threatening fish or human researchers
- **Debris removal**: Use jets to move unwanted objects from den area

### Object Manipulation
- **Bivalve props**: Use rocks/shells to keep clam shells open while feeding
- **Den construction**: Arrange rocks and shells to create complex shelters
- **Problem solving**: Demonstrate flexibility in object use for various purposes

## Cognitive Abilities
- **Planning**: Carry tools for future use (not immediate deployment)
- **Flexibility**: Adapt tool use to different situations and threats
- **Learning**: Improve tool use efficiency with experience
- **Innovation**: Modify tools and techniques based on available materials

## Research Context
- **Discovery**: First reported in detailed study by Finn, Tregenza & Norman (2009)
- **Location**: Dive sites off Northern Sulawesi, Indonesia
- **Observation**: Multiple individuals filmed using shells over extended periods
- **Significance**: Challenged assumptions about invertebrate cognitive capabilities

## Significance
Represents the first clear evidence of tool use by an invertebrate for future deployment, demonstrating sophisticated planning abilities previously thought to exist only in vertebrates. Shows that complex tool use can evolve in marine environments despite physical constraints.
