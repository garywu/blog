# Sea Otters: Marine Tool Specialists

## Core Identity
- **Species**: Enhydra lutris
- **Habitat**: Coastal North Pacific Ocean
- **Distinction**: Most sophisticated tool users among marine mammals
- **Tool frequency**: Spend up to 21% of foraging time using tools

## Tool Arsenal

### Rock Tools
- **Size selection**: 6-15 cm diameter preferred
- **Function**: Hammers and anvils for cracking prey
- **Transport**: Carried in specialized skin pouches under arms
- **Reuse**: Same rock used for multiple prey items

### Kelp Tools
- **Wrapping**: Immobilize crabs while eating other captured prey
- **Anchoring**: Wrap in kelp during rest to maintain position
- **Buoyancy aid**: Helps maintain surface position

## Techniques

### Anvil Method
- **Position**: Float on back at surface
- **Setup**: Place rock on chest as anvil
- **Action**: Pound shellfish against rock at 2 strikes per second
- **Success**: Average 35 blows to crack mussel

### Hammer Method
- **Underwater**: Use rocks to hammer abalone from substrate
- **Surface**: Use rock as hammer against prey held in paws
- **Tool composite**: Use one rock as anvil, another as hammer

## Individual Specialization
- **Non-users**: Many otters never use tools, target soft prey instead
- **Tool users**: 10-93% of individuals per population use tools
- **Variation**: 0.3-21% of time budget spent on tool use
- **Sex differences**: Females more likely to use tools than males

## Learning & Transmission
- **Maternal teaching**: Pups learn techniques from mothers
- **Practice period**: Young otters practice with non-functional objects
- **Tool preference**: Daughters adopt mother's specific techniques and tool preferences
- **Development**: Tool use skills peak in mid-adulthood

## Geographic Variation
- **Alaska**: 1% of dives involve tool use
- **California**: 16% of dives involve tool use
- **Prey availability**: Tool use correlates with hard-shelled prey abundance

## Significance
Represents the most sophisticated tool use among marine mammals, with clear individual specialization, cultural transmission, and adaptation to specific prey types. Demonstrates that aquatic environments can support complex tool-using behaviors despite physical constraints.
