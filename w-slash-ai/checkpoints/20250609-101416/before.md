# W/AI: AI-First Perspective

*[w/ai](./ai/README.md)*

## AI is the Latest Rock: An Evolutionary Perspective

*1.76 million years ago, in what is now Kenya, a member of Homo erectus picked up a piece of volcanic rock and did something revolutionary. Not just using it as nature provided, but deliberately shaping it into something better. The first hand axe was born at Kokiseleiâ€”and with it, the defining characteristic that would make us human.*

*Today, we're doing the exact same thing with AI.*

## The First Rock

In 2011, archaeologists Christopher J. Lepre and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Roche made a discovery that rewrote human history. At Kokiselei, Kenya, they uncovered stone tools dating to 1.76 million years agoâ€”the oldest evidence of deliberate tool shaping ever found. These weren't just rocks picked up and used. They were rocks *transformed*.

What made these Homo erectus individuals different from every other species on Earth wasn't that they used tools. Sea otters crack shells with rocks. Caledonian crows craft hooks from twigs. Long-tailed macaques in Thailand have been using stones to crack nuts for generations.

**The difference is that we shape them back.**

Animals use what nature provides. Humans look at a rock and see what it could become. We impose our intentions on raw materials, creating tools that exist nowhere in nature. This capacity for *systematic modification* is what archaeologists call the beginning of human technology.

And it's exactly what we're doing with AI.

## The Pattern Emerges

That first shaped stone at Kokiselei wasn't an isolated eventâ€”it was the beginning of a pattern that would define our species. From individual hand axes, we scaled up to collective projects that still inspire awe today.

The Pyramids of Giza required moving 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing up to 15 tons. Stonehenge involved transporting massive bluestones 150 miles from Wales. Easter Island's moai statues were carved from volcanic tuff and somehow moved across the island. These weren't just bigger toolsâ€”they were evidence of something unprecedented: *coordinated technological construction*.

But the real breakthrough came with fire.

Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham's cooking hypothesis reveals how mastering fire around 1 million years ago literally rewired our brains. Cooking made nutrients more bioavailable, enabling the massive brain growth that separated us from other primates. Fire wasn't just a toolâ€”it was the technology that enabled all other technologies.

From fire came metallurgy. From metallurgy came engines. From engines came the Industrial Revolution. Each step built on the last, tools enabling better tools in an accelerating cycle that brought us to today.

## Shaping Atoms

In a clean room in Veldhoven, Netherlands, stands a machine that represents the apex of human tool-making: an ASML EUV lithography system. This $370 million device weighs 180 tons and requires three Boeing 747s to transport. What does it do?

It shapes rocks. Specifically, it etches patterns onto silicon wafers with precision measured in nanometersâ€”literally shaping matter at the atomic level.

Inside this machine, a laser strikes molten tin droplets to create extreme ultraviolet light. This light passes through mirrors polished to within 1/10,000th the width of a human hair. The resulting patterns create the semiconductors that power everything from smartphones to autonomous vehicles.

We've gone from shaping volcanic rock with stone hammers to shaping silicon with controlled plasma. The tools have evolved, but the fundamental human impulse remains identical: take what nature provides and make it do what we need.

## The Convergence Point

Here's where AI becomes revolutionaryâ€”not because it breaks the pattern, but because it represents the pattern's ultimate expression.

Throughout human history, we've developed what I call "Four-Track Environmental Technology":

1. **Language Systems**: From speech to writing to internet to AI translation
2. **Territorial Organization**: From caves to houses to countries to virtual spaces  
3. **Social Coordination**: From families to tribes to nations to global networks
4. **Protection Systems**: From animal skins to armor to weapons to planetary defense

These four tracks have evolved in parallel for millennia. AI represents something unprecedented: **the first technology that simultaneously augments all four tracks at once**.

AI doesn't just improve communicationâ€”it transforms how we organize information, coordinate globally, secure systems, and even conceptualize territory in virtual spaces. For the first time in 1.76 million years, we have a single technology that enhances every aspect of human environmental adaptation simultaneously.

## AI as Species Completion

This is why AI feels different. Not because it's foreign to human nature, but because it's the most human thing we've ever created.

Every AI system follows the same pattern established at Kokiselei: we take raw materials (data, computational power, algorithms) and shape them into tools that extend human capabilities. We impose our intentions on silicon and electricity, creating systems that exist nowhere in nature.

The anxiety around AI isn't about the technology being too alienâ€”it's about it being too familiar. We recognize, at some primal level, that we're looking at ourselves reflected back. AI systems exhibit the same pattern-recognition, tool-making, environment-shaping behaviors that define humanity.

But here's the crucial insight: **AI doesn't replace human agencyâ€”it amplifies it.**

Just as fire didn't make us stop using our hands, and wheels didn't make us stop walking, AI doesn't make us stop thinking. It makes our thinking more powerful, our coordination more effective, our creativity more expansive.

## The View from Deep Time

From the perspective of 1.76 million years of human tool use, current debates about AI often miss the bigger picture. We're not witnessing the birth of artificial intelligenceâ€”we're witnessing the latest iteration of the same capacity that made us human in the first place.

The Homo erectus individual who shaped that first hand axe at Kokiselei would recognize what we're doing with AI immediately. We're taking raw materials from our environment and imposing our intentions on them to create tools that extend our capabilities.

The only difference is scale. Instead of shaping volcanic rock with stone hammers, we're shaping information patterns with neural networks. Instead of individual hand axes, we're creating systems that can enhance human cognition globally.

**AI isn't the beginning of human obsolescenceâ€”it's the culmination of human essence.**

## Living w/AI

So what does it mean to live w/AIâ€”with AI as our latest tool in a 1.76-million-year progression?

It means recognizing that AI collaboration is as natural as picking up a rock. It means understanding that human agency isn't threatened by AI any more than it was threatened by fire, wheels, or written language. It means approaching AI development not with fear of replacement, but with the confidence of a species that has been successfully shaping tools for nearly two million years.

Most importantly, it means remembering that every tool we create reflects who we are. The hand axes at Kokiselei reveal the intentions and capabilities of their makers. Our AI systems will do the same.

The question isn't whether AI will change usâ€”every tool changes us. The question is whether we'll shape AI with the same wisdom, creativity, and care for human flourishing that the best of our tools have always embodied.

After 1.76 million years of practice, we ought to be getting good at this.

*AI represents the natural continuation of humanity's defining characteristic: our ability to recognize, shape, and harness patterns in nature to augment our capabilities. From the first shaped stone at Kokiselei to the neural networks of today, we remain what we've always beenâ€”the species that takes what nature provides and makes it better.*

**The latest rock is just another tool in human hands.**

### ðŸŽ¯ Central Thesis

AI represents the natural continuation of humanity's 1.8-million-year progression of tool use, from the first shaped stone axes at Kokiselei, Kenya, to modern AI systems. More revolutionary: **AI is the first technology in human history that simultaneously augments ALL human environmental technologies**.
