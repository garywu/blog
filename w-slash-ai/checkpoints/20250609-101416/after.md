# W/AI: AI-First Perspective

## AI is the Latest Rock: An Evolutionary Perspective

*1.76 million years ago, in what is now Kenya, someone—let's call her Kesi—found a piece of volcanic basalt by the lakeshore. She'd watched her mother and aunts work stone for years, learning the rhythm of strikes, the feel of good fracture lines. What had taken her ancestors millennia to develop, she inherited through careful observation and practice.*

*Kesi selected a hammerstone worn smooth by generations of use and began systematically striking the basalt at angles her grandmother had taught her. With each carefully aimed blow, she removed flakes of stone, revealing sharp edges beneath. She rotated the rock as she'd seen done countless times, reading the grain the way her family read the landscape.*

*Hours of patient work—guided by accumulated knowledge passed down through generations—transformed rough volcanic stone into something elegant: a symmetrical hand axe with sharp cutting edges and a comfortable grip. This wasn't invention; it was refinement of ancient wisdom, each generation building on the last.*

*Seven years ago, in Auburn, Nebraska—population 3,385, surrounded by cornfields and cattle ranches—twelve-year-old Brent Comstock started BCom Solutions from his bedroom. What began as fixing neighbors' computers grew into something remarkable.*

*By the time Brent left for college, BCom had over 500 clients nationwide. Rural businesses across America discovered they could get enterprise-level tech support from a farm kid who understood their challenges. No Silicon Valley overhead, no language barriers, just practical solutions delivered with Midwestern reliability.*

*Today, Brent splits his time between the University of North Carolina and Auburn, working on his Rural Innovation Catalyst Program—bringing startup accelerators to farming communities. He's proving that innovation doesn't require zip codes with venture capital.*

*Brent took raw materials—servers, software, rural work ethic, and an understanding of overlooked markets—and shaped them into something that didn't exist before. Something useful. Something human.*

*1.76 million years apart, the same pattern: taking what nature provides and making it better.*

## The First Rock

In 2011, archaeologists Christopher J. Lepre and Hélène Roche made a discovery that rewrote human history. At Kokiselei, Kenya, they uncovered stone tools dating to 1.76 million years ago—the oldest evidence of deliberate tool shaping ever found. These weren't just rocks picked up and used. They were rocks *transformed*.

What made these Homo erectus individuals different from every other species on Earth wasn't that they used tools. Sea otters crack shells with rocks. Caledonian crows craft hooks from twigs. Long-tailed macaques in Thailand have been using stones to crack nuts for generations.

**The difference is that we shape them back.**

Animals use what nature provides. Humans look at a rock and see what it could become. We impose our intentions on raw materials, creating tools that exist nowhere in nature. Archaeologists call this capacity for *systematic modification* the beginning of human technology.

And it's exactly what we're doing with AI.

We start with silicon—literally refined sand, the same basic rock material—and shape it into wafers through precise heating and chemical processes. Those wafers become microchips through photolithography, where we etch microscopic patterns onto silicon surfaces. The chips become processors that power servers. The servers become data centers. The data centers become the cloud infrastructure running AI models.

Every smartphone, every laptop, every AI system that writes code or recognizes faces or drives cars—it's all shaped rock. A trillion-dollar global economy built on the same fundamental pattern: taking what nature provides and systematically modifying it into tools that extend human capabilities.

We've come an extraordinary distance from Kesi's hand axe to GPT models, but at the core, it's still the same thing: humans shaping rocks to think better.

## The Pattern Emerges

That first shaped stone at Kokiselei wasn't an isolated event—it was the beginning of a pattern that would define our species. From individual hand axes, we scaled up to collective projects that still inspire awe today.

The Pyramids of Giza required moving 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing up to 15 tons. Stonehenge involved transporting massive bluestones 150 miles from Wales. Easter Island's moai statues were carved from volcanic tuff and somehow moved across the island. These weren't just bigger tools—they were evidence of something unprecedented: *coordinated technological construction*.

But the real breakthrough came with fire.

Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham's cooking hypothesis reveals how mastering fire around 1 million years ago literally rewired our brains. Cooking made nutrients more bioavailable, enabling the massive brain growth that separated us from other primates. Fire wasn't just a tool—it was the technology that enabled all other technologies.

From fire came metallurgy. From metallurgy came engines. From engines came the Industrial Revolution. Each step built on the last, tools enabling better tools in an accelerating cycle that brought us to today.

## Shaping Atoms

In a clean room in Veldhoven, Netherlands, stands a machine that represents the apex of human tool-making: an ASML EUV lithography system. This $370 million device weighs 180 tons and requires three Boeing 747s to transport. What does it do?

It shapes rocks. Specifically, it etches patterns onto silicon wafers with precision measured in nanometers—literally shaping matter at the atomic level.

Inside this machine, a laser strikes molten tin droplets to create extreme ultraviolet light. This light passes through mirrors polished to within 1/10,000th the width of a human hair. The resulting patterns create the semiconductors that power everything from smartphones to autonomous vehicles.

We've gone from shaping volcanic rock with stone hammers to shaping silicon with controlled plasma. The tools have evolved, but the fundamental human impulse remains identical: take what nature provides and make it do what we need.

## The Convergence Point

What makes AI revolutionary isn't that it breaks the pattern, but that it represents the pattern's ultimate expression.

Looking across human history, a pattern emerges in how we've developed technology:

1. **Language Systems**: From speech to writing to internet to AI translation
2. **Territorial Organization**: From caves to houses to countries to virtual spaces  
3. **Social Coordination**: From families to tribes to nations to global networks
4. **Protection Systems**: From animal skins to armor to weapons to planetary defense

These four tracks have evolved in parallel for millennia. AI represents something unprecedented: **the first technology that simultaneously augments all four tracks at once**.

AI doesn't just improve communication—it transforms how we organize information, coordinate globally, secure systems, and even conceptualize territory in virtual spaces. For the first time in 1.76 million years, we have a single technology that enhances every aspect of human environmental adaptation simultaneously.

## AI as Species Completion

Notice how AI feels different. Not because it's foreign to human nature, but because it's the most human thing we've ever created.

Every AI system follows the same pattern established at Kokiselei: we take raw materials (data, computational power, algorithms) and shape them into tools that extend human capabilities. We impose our intentions on silicon and electricity, creating systems that exist nowhere in nature.

The anxiety around AI isn't about the technology being too alien—it's about it being too familiar. We recognize, at some primal level, that we're looking at ourselves reflected back. AI systems exhibit the same pattern-recognition, tool-making, environment-shaping behaviors that define humanity.

But here's the crucial insight: **AI doesn't replace human agency—it amplifies it.**

Just as fire didn't make us stop using our hands, and wheels didn't make us stop walking, AI doesn't make us stop thinking. It makes our thinking more powerful, our coordination more effective, our creativity more expansive.

## The View from Deep Time

From the perspective of 1.76 million years of human tool use, current debates about AI often miss the bigger picture. We're not witnessing the birth of artificial intelligence—we're witnessing the latest iteration of the same capacity that made us human in the first place.

That ancient tool-maker who shaped the first hand axe at Kokiselei—our Kesi—would recognize what we're doing with AI immediately. We're taking raw materials from our environment and imposing our intentions on them to create tools that extend our capabilities.

The only difference is scale. Instead of shaping volcanic rock with stone hammers, we're shaping information patterns with neural networks. Instead of individual hand axes, we're creating systems that can enhance human cognition globally.

**AI isn't the beginning of human obsolescence—it's the culmination of human essence.**

## Living w/AI

So what does it mean to live w/AI—with AI as our latest tool in a 1.76-million-year progression?

It means recognizing that AI collaboration is as natural as picking up a rock. It means understanding that human agency isn't threatened by AI any more than it was threatened by fire, wheels, or written language. It means approaching AI development not with fear of replacement, but with the confidence of a species that has been successfully shaping tools for nearly two million years.

Most importantly, it means remembering that every tool we create reflects who we are. The hand axes at Kokiselei reveal the intentions and capabilities of their makers. Our AI systems will do the same.

The question isn't whether AI will change us—every tool changes us. The question is whether we'll shape AI with the same wisdom, creativity, and care for human flourishing that the best of our tools have always embodied.

After 1.76 million years of practice, we ought to be getting good at this.

*AI represents the natural continuation of humanity's defining characteristic: our ability to recognize, shape, and harness patterns in nature to augment our capabilities. From the first shaped stone at Kokiselei to the neural networks of today, we remain what we've always been—the species that takes what nature provides and makes it better.*

**The latest rock is just another tool in human hands.**
