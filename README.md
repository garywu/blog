## 🧠 AI Knowledge Base Principles

### The `ai/` Folder Structure
Each blog post contains an `ai/` subdirectory that serves as the **knowledge base and working memory** for creating that blog post. This folder contains:

1. **README.md**: Overall creation documentation and rationale
2. **Atomic topic files**: Individual `.md` files for each specific concept

### **ATOMIC, AUTHORITATIVE, ENERGETIC** Principles

#### 🔬 **ATOMIC**
- **One concept per file**: Each file focuses on exactly one thing
- **Self-contained**: Can be understood independently 
- **Specific naming**: Use the actual name of the thing (e.g., `kokiselei.md`, not `ancient-site-research.md`)
- **Focused scope**: Don't combine multiple topics in one file

#### 📚 **AUTHORITATIVE** 
- **Referenced**: Include specific citations and sources
- **Factual**: Use precise dates, measurements, and data
- **Credible sources**: Wikipedia, academic papers, official websites
- **Verifiable**: Claims should be checkable

#### ⚡ **ENERGETIC**
- **Engaging tone**: Write with enthusiasm and interest
- **Story elements**: Include human details, discovery moments, personal quotes
- **Vivid descriptions**: Make the content come alive
- **Dynamic language**: Use active voice and compelling narratives

### Knowledge Base File Examples

**Good atomic files:**
- `kokiselei.md` - Specific archaeological site
- `asml-machines.md` - Specific technology 
- `pyramids.md` - Specific historical building method
- `trebuchets.md` - Specific medieval technology

**Bad atomic files:**
- `ancient-tools-research.md` - Too broad, combines multiple concepts
- `general-findings.md` - Vague and unfocused
- `technology-overview.md` - Lacks specificity

## 📝 Blog Post Creation Guidelines

### Structure Standards
Each blog post follows this pattern:
- **README.md**: Main index with author link `*[w/ai](./ai/README.md)*`
- **Numbered chapters**: Single-digit prefix (1-9)
- **Kebab-case names**: Lowercase with hyphens
- **Assets folder**: For supporting materials
- **AI folder**: Knowledge base and creation documentation

### Content Quality Standards
- **GitHub-compatible markdown**: Standard formatting
- **Practical examples**: Real-world implementation details
- **Security awareness**: Best practices and considerations
- **Cross-platform considerations**: macOS, Linux, WSL2 coverage
- **Progressive complexity**: Basic to advanced concepts

## 🏗️ Creating New Blog Posts

### Step 1: Set Up Structure
```bash
mkdir -p tmp/blog/new-blog/{assets,ai}
```

### Step 2: Create Knowledge Base
- Start with `ai/README.md` documenting the creation rationale
- Add atomic files for each key concept (following A.A.E. principles)

## 💡 Key Philosophy

This blog repository represents the **intersection of human creativity and AI capabilities**. Each post is transparently marked with `w/ai` attribution, and the AI knowledge bases serve as both creation tools and documentation of the collaborative process.

The goal is to create **immediately useful, thoroughly documented, and engaging content** that serves the developer community while advancing our understanding of human-AI collaboration in technical writing.

## 🔄 **Blog Creation Workflow**

### **Standard Process for Every New Blog Post:**

#### **Phase 1: Structure & Foundation**
1. **Set up blog post structure**
   - Create main blog directory: `tmp/blog/[post-name]/`
   - Initialize AI research folder: `tmp/blog/[post-name]/ai/`

## 🔬 Phase 2: Critical Analysis & Reference Enhancement

After completing the initial brainstorming and knowledge base creation, the next phase requires rigorous intellectual validation:

### **🔍 IMMEDIATE GROUND TRUTH VERIFICATION**

**Before any other analysis, each atomic file must pass this verification:**

#### **Quick Verification Checklist (for each claim)**
1. **Is this actually true?**
   - Can I find this in 3+ independent authoritative sources?
   - What's the PRIMARY source for this claim?
   - Who originally discovered/documented this?

2. **Are these details accurate?**
   - Names: Spelled correctly and verified to exist?
   - Dates: Cross-checked against archaeological/historical records?
   - Locations: Confirmed on maps and in official site records?
   - Numbers: Verified through peer-reviewed scientific literature?

3. **What might I be making up?**
   - Where am I inferring connections that might not exist?
   - What details sound suspiciously convenient for my argument?
   - What claims need explicit "this is speculation" disclaimers?

4. **Source quality check:**
   - Primary sources vs. popular interpretations?
   - Peer-reviewed vs. journalistic accounts?
   - Recent findings vs. potentially outdated claims?
   - Scientific consensus vs. individual researcher opinions?

#### **🚨 RED FLAGS requiring immediate verification:**
- Any specific measurement, date, or location
- Researcher names and their claimed discoveries
- Technical specifications (brain volumes, machine capabilities)
- Archaeological site names and their discovery histories
- Timeline connections that seem too neat/convenient

### Fact-Checking Protocol

#### 🚨 **Ground Truth Verification - Anti-Hallucination Protocol**

**Every specific claim must be independently verified:**

1. **Names & People**
   - Verify all researcher names exist and are correctly spelled
   - Confirm their institutional affiliations and credentials
   - Check that quoted individuals actually said what we claim
   - Cross-reference multiple biographical sources

2. **Dates & Timeline**
   - Verify all historical dates against multiple authoritative sources
   - Confirm archaeological dating methods and their accuracy ranges
   - Check for conflicting date claims in the literature
   - Flag any dates that seem suspiciously precise or round numbers

3. **Places & Locations**
   - Confirm all archaeological sites exist and are correctly named
   - Verify geographical locations, coordinates, and regional descriptions
   - Check site discovery histories and excavation details
   - Cross-reference site names across multiple sources

4. **Technical Specifications**
   - Verify all measurements, weights, dimensions, temperatures
   - Confirm ASML machine specifications through official sources
   - Check brain volume measurements against anthropological literature
   - Validate any technical process descriptions

5. **Publications & Studies**
   - Verify all cited papers actually exist and are correctly referenced
   - Check publication dates, journal names, and author lists
   - Confirm DOI links and citation accuracy
   - Flag any studies that cannot be independently located

#### **Hallucination Detection Flags**
- **Suspiciously specific details** without clear sourcing
- **Perfect round numbers** (exactly 1M years, exactly 50%, etc.)
- **Overly dramatic narratives** that may be embellished
- **Connections that seem too convenient** for our argument
- **Claims that appear in only one source** or cannot be cross-verified

#### 1. Archaeological Claims Verification
- Cross-reference all dates, locations, and discoveries
- Verify researcher names, institutions, and publication details  
- Check for contradictory evidence or updated findings
- Validate technical specifications (ASML machines, brain volumes, etc.)

#### 2. Scientific Hypothesis Validation
- Critically examine Wrangham's cooking hypothesis
- Review counterarguments and alternative theories
- Check current scientific consensus on each claim
- Identify areas where evidence is weak or disputed

#### 3. Historical Timeline Accuracy
- Verify progression dates across all technology categories
- Check for gaps, overlaps, or inconsistencies
- Ensure archaeological evidence supports claimed timelines
- Cross-reference with established historical frameworks

### Critical Analysis Framework

#### 1. Argument Strength Assessment
- Identify weakest links in "AI is latest rock" thesis
- Test convergence theory against counterexamples
- Examine potential over-generalizations or cherry-picking
- Question assumed causal relationships

#### 2. Alternative Explanations
- Research competing theories for human technological evolution
- Examine non-linear or discontinuous development models
- Consider cultural vs. technological determinism arguments
- Investigate "AI is fundamentally different" perspectives

#### 3. Scope and Limitation Analysis
- Define boundaries of the argument
- Identify what the theory doesn't explain
- Acknowledge cultural and geographical biases
- Examine applicability across different human societies

### Reference Integration & Intellectual Context
