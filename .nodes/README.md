## üìù **[Ogilvy's "How To Write" Memo (1982)](ogilvy-memo-1982.md)**

### **The Legend**
David Ogilvy's internal memo to Ogilvy & Mather became one of the most influential business writing documents ever created. Written in 1982, it distilled decades of advertising wisdom into 10 actionable principles.

### **Key Philosophy**
- **"Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well"**
- **"People who think well, write well"**
- **Writing = results** - Clear communication drives action

### **The 10 Ogilvy Principles**
1. **Study the craft** - Read Roman-Raphaelson book three times
2. **Write naturally** - Write the way you talk
3. **Keep it short** - Short words, sentences, paragraphs
4. **No jargon** - Avoid corporate speak and buzzwords
5. **Two page limit** - Never exceed two pages on any subject
6. **Check quotations** - Verify all quoted material
7. **Sleep on it** - Edit with fresh eyes the next day
8. **Get help** - Use colleagues to improve important writing
9. **Clear action** - Make crystal clear what you want readers to do
10. **Don't write for action** - If you want ACTION, tell them in person

### **Why It Endures**
These principles work across all mediums - memos, emails, blog posts, or any communication where clarity matters. Ogilvy understood that clear thinking produces clear writing, and clear writing gets results.

## üéØ **[Timeless Writing Principles for Modern Blogs](writing-principles-timeless.md)**

### **The Evolution**
This document adapts timeless writing wisdom for modern blog creation, especially in the AI era. It bridges classic principles with contemporary challenges.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Simple communication wins
- **Natural voice** - Conversational, authentic tone
- **Reader-first thinking** - Serve the audience, not the ego

### **Essential Elements**

#### **Universal Principles**
- **Simple words** beat complex ones
- **Active voice** stronger than passive
- **Concrete examples** more powerful than abstractions
- **Logical structure** guides readers through arguments

#### **Modern Applications**
- **AI-Assisted Writing**: Human voice remains essential
- **Blog Posts**: Hook immediately, deliver value consistently
- **Technical Topics**: Use analogies, build complexity gradually

#### **The Editing Process**
1. Write freely first - get ideas down
2. Sleep on it - fresh perspective reveals problems
3. Read aloud - hear rhythm and flow
4. Cut ruthlessly - every word must earn its place
5. Test clarity - would a friend understand this?

### **Why These Work**
Human attention is limited and precious. Good writing respects readers by being clear, useful, and easy to consume. These principles worked in 1982 and work in 2024.
